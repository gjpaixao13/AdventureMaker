AdventureMaker
==============

This program creates a world and simulates it's history. You create a character that is put in a certain age of this world, and it's life is simulated(as a RPG, you choose his class,race,name etc). After his whole life passed, you can choose to whether continue with his children, and how many generations you want to see, or just stop. Then the program logs the whole adventure, as well as the history of the world.
